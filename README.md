# altered_BWO_B41_V1_Lua_files

- These are the altered Lua files from the Legacy V1 version of Slayer's Week One mod for Project Zomboid which will allow the player to work as a 9 to 5 chef or fast food worker during the final week

- this Lua code replaces the existing code within THIS mod:
    - "[B41] Week One NPC" (by Slayer)

At the moment it is only designed to work with this old (legacy) V1 version of Bandits mod.

All credit goes to Slayer who made the entire Week One mod; all we've done is make a few tiny alterations to a couple of the existing files in order to allow us to do some additional things within it.

Anyone who wants to take any of this code and alter or improve upon it is free to do so: ideally just credit people if you do
